# 🎓 Student Management System (Python + SQLite)

A simple, menu-driven **Student Management System** developed using **Python** and **SQLite** as part of my **Python Developer Internship**.  
This project performs complete **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on student records using a clean and modular code structure.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Student Management System helps manage student records efficiently through a console-based interface.  
It allows users to:

- Add new student records
- View all students
- Search students by ID
- Delete a single student
- Delete all student records at once

This project demonstrates real-world usage of Python with database connectivity.
